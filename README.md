Jetpack-Sharing-Styles
======================

I like the Jetpack sharing module quite a bit and use it often. However I'm not a big fan of the styling...

Unfortunately, the original css is quite specific and liberaly uses !important's so I had to follow suit.

Jetpack gives you the option to disable js/css (both or nothing) and manually include them into your files. I've not done this yet but it may be a better way to go. You would just have to make sure your minifying and concatenating your files otherwise you'd be adding more bytes then the solution offered here. 

You can see a screenshot in the Wiki.
