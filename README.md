Jetpack-Sharing-Styles
======================

I like Jetpack sharing module quite a bit and use it often. However I'm not a big fan of the styling...

Unfortunately, the original css is quite specific and liberaly uses !important's so I had to follow suit.

Jetpack gives you the option to disable js/css (both or nothing) and include them into your files. I've not done this yet but it may be a better way to go. You would just have to make sure your minifying and concatenating your files otherwise you'd be adding more bytes then the solution here. Enjoy.
